<h3>Setting up the menu</h3>
<p>
    Monstroid supports custom WordPress menus, with multiple levels of dropdown support for the main menu. There are 4
    areas of the theme where you can assign a menu: Shop, Landing, Primary and Secondary. Each of these menu locations
    can have a custom menu assigned. Once a menu is created and assigned to the location, it will show up on the site.
    There are also several theme options to customize the menu. Please see below for the menu locations, how to create a
    new menu and the menu theme options.
