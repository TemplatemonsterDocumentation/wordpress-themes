<h2>WPML configuration</h2>

<h5>WPML consists of several modules. The basic module turns WordPress sites multilingual. Other modules help with an enhanced translation process, string translation, media translation and other functions.</h5>
    
<p>You can learn about the different modules in the <a href="http://wpml.org/documentation/wpml-core-and-add-on-plugins/" target="_blank"><strong>WPML Core and Addons</strong></a> page.</p>
    
<p>After you enable WPML, you’ll see a Multilingual Widget in the Admin Dashboard. This widget provides access to the different functions in WPML. You can also access them through the <strong>WPML menu</strong>.</p>

	<li><a href="http://wpml.org/documentation/getting-started-guide/language-setup/" target="_blank">Languages</a> – Determine the site’s languages and control how different language contents are organized.</li>

<h4>Translating Site Content</h4>

<p>WPML creates different posts, pages and custom types for translations and connects them together. This means that every page has its own title, body and meta-fields.</p>
    
<p>WPML offers two ways for translating content:</p>
<ul class="marked-list">
	<li>Manually, by clicking on the + icons</li>
	<li>Using WPML’s Translation Management module</li>
</ul>
